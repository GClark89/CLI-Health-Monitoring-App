# CLI-Health-Monitoring-App
TLAB 1 - Phase 1 

Intro


You are a software developer at a Taiwan-based wearable health-tech firm called Seng-Links Links to an external site.. For your next project, you will assist in the creation of an application which will ingest 8 hours of user inputted heart-rate data and rate their quality of sleep. As the final project will take many months of hardware and software development, you are tasked with solely designing a simple command-line application which developers can use to prototype to product. 

Your manager has completed the framework of this project, along with pertinent instructions, but now relies on your Python knowledge and documentation-reading skills to complete the rest.

Instructions


Begin this project by reading all sections of the README.md document. Once you understand the directions, utilize documentation, your peers, readings, and classroom notes to complete this project. Each section of this project has been commented for you, so your task will entail interpreting the code comments in order to write the intended line of code.
